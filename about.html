    <p class="list-answer">We recognize that, while societal expectations and cultural norms keep men from seeking help, we also wish to critique the system's inability to adress and help sove men's issues properly.<br><br> And while many men often may feel discouraged by various factors from seeking help, many others do actively seek help but the system isn't equipped to help them properly. <br>

      <br>This can lead to higher rates of suicide, substance abuse, and untreated mental health conditions. Through education, advocacy and destigmatization, we aim to create a supportive environment where men's issues are heard and people take a step forwards into adressing them properly with empathy and care.</p>
